# Global-Population-Analysis

This project explores global population and poverty trends from 1970-2017, in particular life expectancy, chid mortality, fertility, and poverty. The goal is to identify key trends and insights from the data over time and across different countries. The results of this project can be used to interpret changes in population and poverty, as well as historic events which have affected these variables. This project uses Python and Python libraries to perform data engineering and data visualization. 

Steps Taken:
1. Examined population data of Bangladesh. by creating a table for total population every year and every five years and calculating the annual population growth every five years. 
2. Explored fertility rates and child mortality rates in Bangladesh over time, and plotted the relationship between these two variables. 
3. Plotted the distribution of fertility rates all countries in 1960 vs. 2010 to explore how fertility rates have changed over time. 
4. Created a plot of population over time for all countries, as well as a scatter plot showing the relationship between fertility rates and child mortality rates for all countries in 1960, the year where global population began to skyrocket.
5. Generated a map of recent areas of extreme poverty as well as a plot of poverty trends over time for India, China, Nigeria, and the United States.
